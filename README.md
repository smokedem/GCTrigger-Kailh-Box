# Kailh-Box-Stem

This is an alternative stem for SimpleControllers' MX Gamecube Trigger mod, which makes it compatible with Kailh Box profile switches. It uses the same mounting brackets found in the original mod: https://github.com/SimpleControllers/MX-Gamecube-Triggers
It also requires you to trim the barrel in the trigger to fit, which leads to some variability. There are two files available - a longer and a shorter one - you may need to try both to see which one fits better.

Your print should be roughly ~13mm long in total (~9mm for the short version), and the base should be 5mm on one side and 5.2mm on the other (it's not exactly square). The tolerances on mine are secure but not overly tight with this sizing, but YMMV.
