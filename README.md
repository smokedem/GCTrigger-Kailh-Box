# Kailh-Box-Stem



This is an alternative stem for SimpleControllers' MX Gamecube Trigger mod, which makes it compatible with Kailh Box profile switches. It uses the same mounting brackets found in the original mod: https://github.com/SimpleControllers/MX-Gamecube-Triggers

This mod requires you to trim the trigger barrel to fit, which leads to some variability in stem length. There are two files available - a longer and a shorter one - you may need to try both to see which one fits better. You can also just print a long one and trim it down.

Your print should be roughly ~13mm long in total (~9mm for the short version), and the base should be 5mm on one side and 5.2mm on the other (it's not exactly square). The tolerances on mine are secure but not overly tight with this sizing, but YMMV.
