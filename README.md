# Kailh-Box-Stem

This is an alternative stem for SimpleControllers' MX Gamecube Trigger mod, which makes it compatible with Kailh Box profile switches. It uses the same mounting brackets found in the original mod: https://github.com/SimpleControllers/MX-Gamecube-Triggers

Your print should be roughly ~13m long in total and the base should be 5mm on one side and 5.2mm on the other (it's not exactly square). The tolerances on mine are secure but not overly tight with this sizing, but YMMV.

Note that depending on how deep/shallow you cut your trigger barrel, you may have to trim the top of the printed stem.
